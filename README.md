# react-ing
The main purpose of this repo is to try out different things in react and push them to git, to keep track. So, that in future, we can easily refer back to specific commit and compare diff changes for quick learning

# How to maintain the repo?

1. for each new project, create a new folder and push things into it
2. if let's say you are learning via udemy, then after each video, make commit with detailed description, to understand what changes we did and what we learnt in that video
