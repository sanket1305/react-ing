1. React uses components (as nodes) wich are linked to each other.
2. React checks the state of each component and compares it with it's own previous state. If there is any change, then only react reloads that component.
3. This reloading of component is actually done by "react dom"... check in package.json

React is Library, where as Angular and Vue are framework
What's the difference? Library is provides a tool that provides specific functionality, while a framework provides a set of tools and guidelines for building apps.
Library => Tool, Framework => Toolsets

React is only used for creating dynamic UI... but we need additional tools for routing, http, managing app state, internationalization, form validation, animations, etc.

Fragment is a way to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. It is useful to avoid unnecessary wrappers.

In JSX, we can only use HTML or other React Components.

In React, each list item SHOULD have a UNIQUE key prop.

By default react is not aware of data changes for any of the variables, so we have to use "State Hook".
Note: Each component will have there own separate state (so if we create 2 comnponents of SAME TYPE, then their state does not depend on each other)

Note: In react we don't call a function, we just provide a reference to it (notice that we did not pass paranthesis) and then react takes of it by doing a function call on listening to particular event

Props vs State
1. Props => input passed to a component, State => Data managed by a component
2. Props => Similar to function args, State => Similar to local variables
3. Props => SHOULD BE treated as IMMUTABLE, State => Mutable (that's the whole purpose of state, to inform react that there has been some change in the component)
4. Any time either Props or State changes, the react will update the DOM accordingly.
