1. React uses components (as nodes) wich are linked to each other.
2. React checks the state of each component and compares it with it's own previous state. If there is any change, then only react reloads that component.
3. This reloading of component is actually done by "react dom"... check in package.json

React is Library, where as Angular and Vue are framework
What's the difference? Library is provides a tool that provides specific functionality, while a framework provides a set of tools and guidelines for building apps.
Library => Tool, Framework => Toolsets

React is only used for creating dynamic UI... but we need additional tools for routing, http, managing app state, internationalization, form validation, animations, etc.
